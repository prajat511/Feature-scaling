# Feature-scaling
Affects on different model:
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression neural network are using gradient descent algorithm to converge -- makes convergence faster for these algorithms

KNN, K-means SVM--( Using distance method)-- It affects the accuracy after converting data into same format 

Tree based alogrithm-- It is insensitive to feature scaling.

Normalization -- converts all data between 0 and 1
Standardization-- converts all data with 0 mean and 1 std.
